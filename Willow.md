★ She/Her ★ Female ★ Ageless/Immortal ★ Mobian Hedgehog/Black Arms hybrid ★

<b>Lore</b>

Willow was created by Gerald Robotnik as a side project to Shadow, trying to experiment further with Black Arms DNA and genetics and figure out how they worked, resulting in a peculiar hedgehog/alien hybrid. The day G.U.N attacked the Space Colony ARK, Willow successfully escaoed her enclosure and the base, being lost by the soldiers and scientists alike as she used an escape pod to flee, eventually landing on earth and dispersing to an unknown location.

Years after not being successfully located by G.U.N, or anyone. Willow was thought dead since it was very unlikely a being like her would be able to survive on her own on a planet like earth itself. However, she was spotted by Shadow and Team Dark, and later captured by them.

Despite her years on the wilderness, she still behaved like a normal mobian, civilized and well-behaved, albeit her rejection for clothes or shoes was pretty obvious, not wanting to use anything that wasn't her inhibitor rings. She would try to escape and return to the wilderness, but she wasn't allowed to, slowly being introduced to the rest of the Sonic cast and bonding with them in their own way.

Willow eventually accepted her own place in Green Hills and, despite not being the most social, she made new friends with whom she spends most of her time with, especially with Team Dark, with whom she spends most of her life with and has a lot of nice, happy memories and moments with. She even accepted wearing small accesories and got herself a piercing, which is now her iconic star earring she wears all the time, matching her star necklace.


<b>Facts</b>

✪ Her tail is prehensile and really flexible.

✪ She uses her small, yet strong horns as a defense mechanism.

✪ Her closest friend is Shadow, who she has bonded the most with.

✪ She likes placing small lavender stems in her head, making her scent smell like the flower itself.
